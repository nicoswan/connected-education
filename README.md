# Connected Education
Opensource project to create a platform and mobile application to connect learners with teachers and tutors through the use of open and free technology. The Platform can stream a live chat with students in a mobile classroom setting or on their handset, tablet, desktop or TV to help them with their lessons or provide lessons remotely. This could give access to excellent teachers which students in impoverished and rural areas wouldn’t otherwise have access to and improve the quality of education. The platform could also be between teachers, tutors and mentor to share and collectively improve the quality of the education provided to students.

The project aims to contribute to the UN “Quality Education” Sustainable Development Goal.
